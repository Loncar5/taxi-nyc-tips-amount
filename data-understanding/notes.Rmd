# Data Import 

Making a single data frame out of many data frames
Creating features that make sense

# Data Understanding and Preparation

Are there any NA's (+), missclasified data types(+), errors and outliners?
We achieve that through descriptive and exploratory statistics. Each is complement to one another. 

- DS

- EDA by data type

```{r}
glimpse(train)

table(train$pickup_neighborhood)
```
TO DO: trip_duration, trip_distance,fare_amount, tolls_amount TMIN TMAX


passenger_count - what is when a passanger is 0? haha 
trip_distance - 7 outliners
extra - one outliner
pickup_neighborhood - make classes with less than 1000 observations into one class. 
dropoff_borough - Staten Island have only 6 observations
dropoff_neighborhood - same as pickup_neighborhood
