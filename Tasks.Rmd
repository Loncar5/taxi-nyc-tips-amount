```

Feature engineering:

- date to date part
- duration
- calculate KPIs: tip/distance etc
- categorical -> dummy
- grouping where necessary
- prep weather data and merge into dataset
- merge population/crime data in (optional)

Start thinking about:

- baseline, evaluation split, evaluation metric

Project report:

- I would like to see a few more plots than you showed today (plots that
help understand business as well as plots that help us with data science)
- bring an outline for getting feedback
