```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Feature engineering:

- partition the date features into more date features by: hour, day and any other options if applicable. (+)
- duration (+)
- calculate KPIs: tip/distance etc (EDA)
- categorical -> dummy (-)
- grouping where necessary, which means to group those rare categories into one category instead of having them many. 
- prep weather data and merge into dataset (+)

- merge population/crime data in (optional)

Start thinking about:

- baseline, evaluation split, evaluation metric

Project report:

- I would like to see a few more plots than you showed today (plots that
help understand business as well as plots that help us with data science)
- bring an outline for getting feedback
